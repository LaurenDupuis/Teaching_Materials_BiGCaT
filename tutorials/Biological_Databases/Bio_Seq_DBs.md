# Practical: Biological Sequence Databases
===================================================
## Practical by: Dr. Lars Eijssen

In this practical session you will use two online-available genome-centered data portals to find information on genes, transcripts, 
proteins and their function.  The first one is the Ensembl genome browser/database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The 
second one is the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data portal, which gives access to a large collection of 
interconnected databases. The two portals share a lot of underlying information and many of the resources are synchronized on a daily 
basis, but the interface at two sites differs largely. The choice which one you want to use will be influenced by your personal preference 
and the task at hand.

Read the practical assignments carefully and try to answer the assignments yourself. If you have any questions you can ask one of the instructors.

### Ensembl genome browser 
[Ensembl](www.ensembl.org) provides genes and other annotation such as regulatory regions, conserved base pairs across species, and sequence variations. 
The Ensembl gene set is based on mRNA evidence in the NCBI RefSeq databases.
